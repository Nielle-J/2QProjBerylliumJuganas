                <h1>Team Comps and Other Tips</h1>

                <p>After learning about the basics of the game, the cookies, and their toppings, it is now time to start
                    thinking of the party of cookies you would want to use for different gamemodes. Learning about the
                    skillset of your cookies and teaming them up based on their compatibility is the key to clearing levels
                    easily.
                </p>
                <h3>Here are some of the most popular comps players use:</h3>

                <h4>Meta Comp</h4>
                <p>This team is composed of Hollyberry in the front, Eclair and Snow Queen in the middle, and Cotton in the rear.
                    The fifth cookie may be any of the following: Strawberry Crepe, Cocoa, Sea Fairy, Pumpkin Pie, Pure Vanilla or Parfait Cookie.
                </p>
                <p> This team is the current strongest team that could be matched, earning the title of the Meta Comp.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Cheese / Gingerscam Comp</h4>
                <p>This team is composed of Gingerbrave and Kumiho in the front, Eclair and Snow Queen in the middle, and Almond in the rear.
                </p>
                <p> This team has been a recommended team for a long time now, surviving and keeping up with the new meta that new cookies bring.
                    It is not the strongest team, but it is effective nonetheless. It relies on Gingerbrave pushing the front line cookies to the back
                    while the rest of the team defeats enemies quickly.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h4>Speed Comp</h4>
                <p>This team is composed of Madeleine in the front, Lilac in the middle, and Mint Choco and Pastry Cookie in the rear.
                    The fifth cookie may be any of the following: Cocoa, Mala Sauce, Eclair, Sparkling or Pure Vanilla.
                </p>
                <p> This team has also stood the test of time, as this team was also founded months ago. This team quickly takes out enemies before they can attack,
                    hence the name speed comp. 
                </p>
                <br>

                <h4>How to make your own Comp</h4>
                <p>The best way to create a comp of cookies you have is by checking their skills and grouping them accordingly.
                    Usually teams are composed of 1-2 Defense or tanks in the front, 1-2 DPS cookies, and support/healer cookies. 
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Extra tips!</h3>
                <br>

                <p>Treasures are extra artifacts you can equip on your team which give you boosts to your cookies.
                    They could be either passive or active. Passive trasures boosts all your cookies for the entire round.
                    Active treasures need to be activated by the player (or is auto-activated when you play on auto) after a certain cooldown time.
                    Use these treasures to enhance your team's skill and efficiency. Some treasures I recommend are the Squishy Jelly Watch,
                    Old Pilgrim's Scroll and the Blind Healer's Staff.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>Make sure to enjoy building your kingdom and place landmarks. These are good investments and it makes your kingdom
                    more aesthetically pleasing. You may look up "cookie run kingdom layouts" on Google to give you ideas on how to decorate it.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>There are codes you can redeem which give you items and crystals. These codes can be found in CRK's social media sites, but
                    an easy list of active codes can be found at <a href="https://www.pockettactics.com/cookie-run-kingdom/codes">https://www.pockettactics.com/cookie-run-kingdom/codes</a>.
                    These are time-limited so redeem them while you can!
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>Lastly, you can always ask for help from your guildmates, or people in the Cookie Run Subreddit. You can even comment
                    on the wiki and people will try to answer you to the best of their abilities. The community is a very talented and loving one,
                    so don't feel bad when asking for help!
