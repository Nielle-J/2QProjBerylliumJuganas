                <h1>Toppings Guide</h1>

                <p>As you progress into the game, you might find these topping slots beside your cookie in their roster. 
                    These toppings help your cookie become stronger in different ways. There are 10 toppings,  
                    you could boost your cookie's attack, attack speed, damage resist, crit resist, 
                    crit rate, defense, hp, debuff resist, or amplify buff or cooldown.</p>
                <p> You can also level these toppings up, which gives extra substats to your toppings!
                    Below is a list of toppings that you can use, and which cookies are best suited for each topping.
                    Note that some cookies need a combination of two toppings; those cookies will be seen in the list of both toppings.
